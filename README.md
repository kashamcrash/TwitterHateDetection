# TwitterHateDetection
Identify hate speech (racist or sexist tweets) in Twitter with NLTK

Analysis to be done:
1. Clean up tweets and build a classification model by using NLP techniques.
2. Cleanup specific parts for tweets data.
3. Use Regularization, hyperparameter tuning, stratified k-fold and cross-validation to get the best model.
